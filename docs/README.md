# Amazon Coding Challenge - Live ScoreBoard

Live ScoreBoard for the Amazon Coding Challenge competition. [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/amazoncodechallenge/).

The competition was hosted at <https://neps.academy>. This app uses Neps API and ignores the penality of contestants that join late, based on a config file.

The [backup](/backup/) directory contains the response from the scores route of Neps API after the contests were over, just in case we ever lose access to the API.
